I wrote this program during my freshman year as part of a homework assignment (copied here as 'Lab11.docx'). The version I turned in is located in the 'Beginning' folder. 

Over the course of the following month or so I continued to add features and functionality to the program, until eventually I got to the 'Final' stage.

I also made a slightly imporoved version, which uses a variable called 'numberOfCars' instead of using a hardcoded value (15). This version is stored in the withNumberOfCars folder. 

Finally, I created the version stored in 'AppletVersion', which modifies the code to turn the program into a Java applet. I don't think I ever got this version fully functional, but I'm not sure.

These were all written in Java in the spring of 2014 using an IDE called JGrasp. Enjoy!
